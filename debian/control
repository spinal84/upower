Package: upower
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, udev
Recommends: pm-utils, policykit-1
Description: abstraction for power management
 upower provides an interface to enumerate power sources on the system
 and control system-wide power management. Any application can access the
 org.freedesktop.UPower service on the system message bus. Some
 operations (such as suspending the system) are restricted using PolicyKit.

Description: abstraction for power management - documentation
 upower provides an interface to enumerate power sources on the system
 and control system-wide power management. Any application can access the
 org.freedesktop.UPower service on the system message bus. Some
 operations (such as suspending the system) are restricted using PolicyKit.

Package: libupower-glib1
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: abstraction for power management - shared library
 upower provides an interface to enumerate power sources on the system
 and control system-wide power management. Any application can access the
 org.freedesktop.UPower service on the system message bus. Some
 operations (such as suspending the system) are restricted using PolicyKit.
 .
 This package contains the shared library to be used by applications.

Package: libupower-glib-dev
Architecture: any
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libglib2.0-dev, libupower-glib1 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: abstraction for power management - development files
 upower provides an interface to enumerate power sources on the system
 and control system-wide power management. Any application can access the
 org.freedesktop.UPower service on the system message bus. Some
 operations (such as suspending the system) are restricted using PolicyKit.
 .
 This package contains files that are needed to build applications.

Package: devicekit-power-doc
Architecture: all
Section: oldlibs
Depends: upower-doc
Description: transitional package to upower-doc
 This is a transitional package to faciliate the upgrade to the new name
 upower-doc. It can be safely removed after the upgrade.

Description: abstraction for power management - shared library (old ABI)
 upower provides an interface to enumerate power sources on the system
 and control system-wide power management. Any application can access the
 org.freedesktop.UPower service on the system message bus. Some
 operations (such as suspending the system) are restricted using PolicyKit.
 .
 This package contains an old version of the shared library to be used by
 applications. It provides the same ABI as the old DeviceKit-power library, but
 works with upower.
